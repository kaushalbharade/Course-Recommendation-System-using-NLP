# 🎓 AI-Based Course Recommendation System using NLP

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Course Recommendation System** that suggests relevant online courses based on user input.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **cosine similarity** to recommend courses that best match a learner’s interests.

The project demonstrates a **practical ML workflow** including data preprocessing, text vectorization, similarity computation, and inference.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
With thousands of online courses available, learners face difficulty identifying the most relevant ones.  
Traditional keyword searches are inefficient and inaccurate.

This system solves the problem by recommending courses based on **semantic similarity** rather than exact keyword matches.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
1. Preprocess and clean course descriptions  
2. Convert text data into numerical vectors  
3. Compute similarity using **Cosine Similarity**  
4. Recommend top-N most relevant courses
